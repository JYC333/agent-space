// Generator-only config: Drizzle schema is the authoring source, but
// drizzle-kit is never used to apply migrations against a live database
// (no `drizzle-kit migrate` / `push`). It diffs `src/db/schema/**` against
// `drizzle/meta/` snapshots and writes plain `.sql` files into `drizzle/`.
// Those files are generator artifacts; `npm run schema:generate` copies the
// applicable ones into `server/migrations/` under the next sequential
// baseline-style prefix, which is what the server migration runner
// (`src/db/migrator.ts`) applies.
//
// `generate`/`check` (the day-to-day and CI commands) are purely file-based
// and never touch a database, so SERVER_DATABASE_URL is not required for them.
// `schema:check` writes Drizzle output into a temporary directory and compares
// it to the committed snapshot so startup/build checks do not mutate the repo.
// Only the one-time bootstrap `pull` (and `push`, which this project doesn't
// use) need real credentials; they'll fail with an ordinary connection error
// if SERVER_DATABASE_URL is unset.
