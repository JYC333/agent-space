/**
 * Transaction helper over the shared `pg` pool.
 *
 * `withTransaction` runs `fn` inside a single `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, rolling back on
 * any thrown error and always releasing the client back to the pool. This is the
 * substrate domain repositories use for multi-statement writes that must be
 * atomic (e.g. proposal apply: active-state write + provenance + accept state).
 *
 * Schema migration is explicit and separate; this only governs how the control
 * plane groups its own statements.
