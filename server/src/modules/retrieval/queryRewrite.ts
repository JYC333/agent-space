 * surface (the query is already user-typed text, sent to a provider exactly like
 * query embedding). It is space-setting-gated, skippable, and never required for
 * correctness: the original query is always searched, variants are only ADDED,
 * and any failure degrades to the original query alone.
 *
 * The engine owns only the seam + the deterministic merge bound; the provider
 * call, prompt, and audit live in the app layer (`modules/retrieval/queryRewriteProvider`).
