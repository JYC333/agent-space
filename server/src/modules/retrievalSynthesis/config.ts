 * Synthesis is a skippable LLM stage routed through the provider task-policy +
 * credential channel (ADR 0010) under its own task name, so a space can point it
 * at a capable chat model independent of the reranker/rewriter. When no
 * `retrieval_synthesis` policy is configured the provider call fails and the
 * brief degrades to the deterministic gap analysis (no LLM answer) — the task
 * policy is therefore the gate; no extra space-setting flag is required.
