/**
 * Phase 12 hardening: bounds unbounded growth of stored `typescript_node`
 * handler source artifacts (`artifact_type = 'intake_custom_source_handler_code'`)
 * across repeated repair cycles. `declarative_pipeline_v1` versions never
 * have a `handler_artifact_id` (their pipeline definition lives in
 * `manifest_json`), so this only ever touches `typescript_node` rows.
 *
 * Deliberately excludes each connection's single most-recently-superseded
 * version — `rollbackHandler`'s default target (`customSourceRepairService.ts`)
 * — so a no-argument rollback is never broken by this job. An explicit
 * `target_version_id` pointing at an older, pruned version will still fail,
 * but with the same pre-existing, clear "Handler source artifact is missing
 * its stored file" error `executeCustomSourceHandler` already raises for a
 * version whose artifact went missing for any other reason — not a new
 * failure mode, just a new way to reach an existing one.
 *
 * Only prunes the artifact (file + row) and clears
 * `handler_artifact_id` — the `source_handler_versions` row itself is kept
 * for audit/history.
