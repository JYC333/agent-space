# Targeted Content Publications

Content publication is the only general-purpose cross-Space content transfer.
It copies an immutable snapshot to explicitly selected target Spaces; it never
grants target members access to the source resource.

## Publish

`POST /api/v1/publications` accepts a registered `resource_type`, a source
resource ID, and one or more target Space IDs.

- The caller must be an active member of every target Space.
- The caller must own the source resource and have `full` access.
- The resource type must have an explicit serializer/importer in the static
  publication adapter registry.
- Artifact snapshots require inline content. Memory snapshots require user scope
  and normal sensitivity. Space Object snapshots are limited to Knowledge items.
- The snapshot is canonicalized, SHA-256 hashed, versioned, and stored independently
  of the source resource.

Supported resource types are `artifact`, `memory`, `space_object` (Knowledge
items), and `task`. Unregistered resource types fail closed.

## Discover And Import

`GET /api/v1/publications?view=received` returns active publications targeted
to the current Space, only when the caller remains an active member. It does not
query or expose the live source resource.

`POST /api/v1/publications/{id}/import` verifies target membership, publication
status, snapshot schema version, and snapshot hash before invoking the registered
importer. The importer creates a new target-Space resource with:

- a new resource ID
- the importing user as owner
- `visibility=private`
- `access_level=full`
- no source Workspace, Project, assignment, run, proposal, or grant references

`content_publication_imports` records the publication version, snapshot hash,
target resource identity, importer, and timestamp. One target Space has at most
one imported copy per publication.

## Revoke

The publisher can revoke an active publication from its source Space. Revocation
prevents discovery and future imports. Existing target copies and import
provenance are not deleted or modified.

## Non-Goals

- no anonymous or public catalog
- no anonymous visibility or global catalog
- no cross-Space grants or direct reads
- no federation, remote fetch, or synchronization
- no source authorization bypass for Space admins
