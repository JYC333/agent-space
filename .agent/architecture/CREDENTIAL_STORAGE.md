# Credential Storage

The system stores secrets in **three distinct channels**. Do not conflate them.

| Channel | What | Where stored | Doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ModelProvider API key** | API keys for in-process LLM calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, …) | AES-256-GCM ciphertext in a DB `Credential` row | this doc |
| **CLI login state** | Claude Code / Codex CLI login profiles for sandboxed runs | files under `instance/secrets/cli-credentials/…`, brokered per run | [modules/credentials.md](../modules/credentials.md) |
| **Custom Source fetch credential** | Header-based credential (API key / bearer token) for an Sources Custom Source's outbound fetches | AES-256-GCM ciphertext in the same DB `credentials` table, distinct `credential_type` and `secret_ref` prefix | [modules/sources.md](../modules/sources.md), [architecture/SOURCE_CUSTOM_SOURCE_HANDLERS.md](SOURCE_CUSTOM_SOURCE_HANDLERS.md) |

This doc covers the **ModelProvider API key** channel — the keys a user configures on the
Providers page, used by the `model_api` runtime adapter, the reflector, and `/providers/chat`.
The **Custom Source fetch credential** channel reuses this channel's DB table and master key
(`server/src/modules/sources/customSources/customSourceCredentialCrypto.ts`,
`server/src/modules/sources/customSources/customSourceCredentialService.ts`) but is functionally distinct: it
resolves to a request header injected only by the trusted Custom Source fetch layer
(`customSourceEndpointFetch.ts`, `customSourcePipelineInterpreter.ts`), never by generated or
interpreted handler code, and it is never pooled/rotated the way ModelProvider keys are.

## At-rest encryption

- **Cipher:** AES-256-GCM (`server/src/modules/providers/secretRefCrypto.ts`). Plaintext → `(ciphertext, nonce)`, both base64.
- **Master key:** a 32-byte random key in a file on disk at
  `AGENT_SPACE_HOME/secrets/provider_keys.key` (auto-generated on first use, `chmod 0600`).
  **The master key is NOT in the database.** A database-only compromise does not reveal keys —
  the on-disk key file is also required.

## Database layout

The plaintext API key is **never** stored. The encrypted material lives in:

| Table | Field | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `model_providers` | `owner_user_id`, `credential_id` (FK) | user-owned provider resource and pointer to the **primary** Credential row. `config_json` does **not** contain the key (any `encrypted_key` is popped before persist). |
| `credentials` | `owner_user_id`, `secret_ref` | user-owned encrypted key material: `model_provider_api_key:v1:<ciphertext_b64>:<nonce_b64>`; `credential_type="api_key"`. |
| `model_provider_space_grants` | grant metadata | explicit provider-to-space grants. Grant rows carry active-space `enabled`, `is_default`, and `network_profile_id` semantics. |
| `model_provider_credentials` | pool membership | 1→N credential **pool** per provider: position, enabled, rotation health (`healthy`, `cooldown_until`, `last_failure_class`, request/failure counters). Holds **no secret material** — only FKs to `credentials`. The primary credential is lazily enrolled as the position-0 member. |
| `provider_task_policies` | per-task chains | one ordered provider/model chain per (space, task) for auxiliary tasks (reflector, condenser, …). No secret material. |

`secret_ref` scheme is defined in
`server/src/modules/providers/secretRefCrypto.ts`
(`encodeModelProviderApiKeySecretRef` / `resolveApiKeyFromSecretRef`).

Rotation strategy (`fill_first` | `round_robin` | `least_used` | `random`) and the
provider fallback chain (`fallback_provider_ids`) remain provider-level
configuration in `model_providers.config_json`. Default provider selection and
NetworkProfile routing are active-space grant fields.

CLI login state is a distinct credential class: it is **never pooled or rotated**, and
the pool tables never reference it.

## Save flow

Providers page → `POST /api/v1/providers` with `api_key` →
`server/src/modules/providers/providerCommandStore.ts`: encrypt API key
→ encode `secret_ref` → create/replace a `Credential` row → set
`ModelProvider.credential_id` → create an enabled grant to the active space.
Only the provider owner can edit provider metadata or API-key material.

## Runtime resolution

`server/src/modules/providers/providerCommandStore.ts` is the canonical
resolver. It first resolves an enabled `model_provider_space_grants` row for
the active run space, then loads the `Credential` → `resolveApiKeyFromSecretRef`
→ AES-GCM decrypt with the on-disk master key → returns plaintext. The
decrypted key is passed to provider invocation **as a parameter** and is never
written to `process.env` — per [ADR 0008](../decisions/0008-credential-channel-isolation.md)
it cannot leak into a CLI subprocess environment. The server store draws keys
from the credential pool with rotation/cooldown state and the same master-key
file. Exactly one side decides credential release: the server.

Claude-compatible CLI provider bindings use the same invariant. The Claude
subprocess receives only a short-lived local provider-proxy lease token through
`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`; the proxy resolves the real ModelProvider API key
inside the server process and replaces the lease token before forwarding the
request upstream.

Codex OpenAI-compatible CLI provider bindings follow the same invariant. For a
selected Codex provider, the server writes only a run-scoped temporary
`CODEX_HOME/config.toml`; its `experimental_bearer_token` is a short-lived
provider-proxy lease token, not the ModelProvider API key. `CODEX_HOME` points
at the run's temporary Codex profile directory. The proxy resolves the real key
inside the server process and forwards the request to the configured
`openai_compatible_base_url`.

## Invariants

- Plaintext key exists only transiently in memory at decrypt time; never in the DB, `config_json`,
  environment variables, or logs (`server/src/modules/runs/evidenceRedaction.ts` redacts RunStep/artifact content).
- The API never returns the key. `ModelProviderOut` exposes only
  `has_api_key: bool`, ownership metadata, and active grant metadata; editing
  supports *replacing* the key, not reading it.
- A provider or credential that lacks an enabled active-space grant fails closed
  before secret resolution.
- Guarded by server provider/runtime adapter tests (adapters must not read ambient `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
  and runtime governance redaction tests.

## Current limitation

The master key is a **local-file symmetric key**, not KMS/HSM-managed. Consequences:

- Whoever can read both `AGENT_SPACE_HOME/secrets/provider_keys.key` and the database can decrypt all
  keys — keep credential-only archives separate from normal DB/data backups; combining them
  carries decryptable material.
- This is appropriate for a single self-hosted instance. Stronger setups (multi-tenant, compliance)
  would move to envelope encryption with a KMS (KMS-wrapped master key, per-space derived subkeys).
  Not implemented today.
