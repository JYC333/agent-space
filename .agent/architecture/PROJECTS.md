# Projects

## What is a Project?

A **Project** is a goal-oriented knowledge and activity container.
It organises activities, artifacts, proposals, agent runs, and linked workspaces around a long-lived objective.
It is the stable ownership and context boundary for durable objects — not a task manager or execution environment.

## What is a Workspace?

A **Workspace** is a file, code, and execution boundary.
It is where agents inspect files, create sandboxes, run commands, collect diffs, and validate changes.
Capability code belongs to a Workspace.

## Project vs Workspace

| Concern | Project | Workspace |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Goal / knowledge / context | File / execution / sandbox |
| Holds | Activities, artifacts, proposals, runs, memory | Files, repos, capability code |
| Created by | User — named objective | User or system — maps to filesystem path |
| Cardinality | One project → many workspaces | One workspace → many projects |
| Capability outputs | Digests, artifacts, proposals, project memory | Capability code itself |

A Project can link to multiple Workspaces.  
A Workspace can serve multiple Projects.  
Capability code lives in a Workspace; its outputs (digests, artifacts, proposals, memory) belong to a Project.

## Information flow

External information should enter the system through the canonical provenance chain:

```
Activity -> Artifact -> Proposal -> Knowledge / Memory / Card
```

Do not write external information directly into active memory.
Each step adds trust validation and human review opportunity.

## Data model

### Project

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID string | Immutable primary key |
| `space_id` | FK → spaces | Hard access boundary; always included in queries |
| `owner_user_id` | FK → users (nullable) | Who controls the project for ACL |
| `name` | string | Unique among active projects within the space (service-layer check) |
| `description` | text (nullable) | Optional long-form description |
| `status` | string | `active` \| `archived` \| `deleted` |
| `current_focus` | text (nullable) | Short statement of current goal |
| `settings_json` | JSON (nullable) | Flexible per-project configuration |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | datetime | Standard timestamps |
| `archived_at` | datetime (nullable) | Set when archived |
| `deleted_at` | datetime (nullable) | Soft-delete marker |

### ProjectWorkspace (association)

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID string | Primary key |
| `project_id` | FK → projects | |
| `workspace_id` | FK → workspaces | Must be in same space as project (service check) |
| `role` | string | `primary_codebase` \| `capability_library` \| `docs` \| `data` \| `deployment` \| `reference` |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | datetime | |

Uniqueness constraint: `(project_id, workspace_id, role)` — a workspace can fill multiple distinct roles for the same project.

### ProjectMember (project memory ACL)

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID string | Primary key |
| `space_id` | FK -> spaces | Same hard boundary as Project |
| `project_id` | FK -> projects | Project whose concrete memory can be read |
| `user_id` | FK -> users | Space member receiving project-level access |
| `role` | string | `owner` \| `member` \| `viewer` |
| `status` | string | `active` \| `revoked` |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | datetime | |

`project_members` is the ACL used by memory read/retrieval surfaces for
project-scoped memory. It does not make project memory public. In shared spaces,
concrete project memory is readable only by the project owner or an active
project member; `viewer` can read gated memory but cannot mutate project
metadata or public summaries.

### ProjectPublicSummary

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID string | Primary key |
| `space_id` | FK -> spaces | Space-public discovery boundary |
| `project_id` | FK -> projects | Unique current summary per project |
| `summary_text` | text | Redacted, high-level project brief only |
| `topics_json` | JSON array | Public aliases/topics for retrieval |
| `highlights_json` | JSON array | Public high-level highlights |
| `source_refs_json` | JSON array | Pointer metadata only; no raw memo/doc content |
| `redaction_version` | string | Sanitization contract version |
| `review_status` | string | `draft` \| `approved` \| `archived` |
| `updated_by_user_id` | FK -> users (nullable) | Last human updater |
| `generated_by_run_id` | FK -> runs (nullable) | Optional generating run, same project/space |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | datetime | |

Project public summaries are intentionally separate from project memory. They
are designed for cross-project discovery and inspiration: approved summaries are
space-public and indexed as retrieval object type `project_public_summary`.
They must be sanitized before write; source refs may identify public pointers
but must not embed raw private memory, memo excerpts, document bodies, or other
concrete project content.

### Project Presets

Project presets are code-owned workflow packs selected when a Project is
created. They are project shape presets, not post-create feature toggles. A
Project's selected preset key is stored in `projects.settings_json.preset` and
the frontend uses it to choose the Project-specific shell, visual treatment, and
primary operations. Changing a Project's preset after creation is not a normal
user workflow.

The current built-in preset is `academic_research`. It reuses normal Project
Sources plus the arXiv, OpenAlex, and Semantic Scholar providers and their monitors, `academic_paper_v1` extraction profile
key, and `academic_citation_v1` graph lens id. Its advertised sections are
`source_monitoring`, `corpus`, and `project_graph`; paper/citation objects are
represented through the core relation/object model and surfaced through the
project corpus and graph lens, not through a second project hierarchy. Academic
projects render a compact Academic Research workflow/status surface with
research-engine discovery, provider monitors, and an entry to the dedicated
Research Workspace. Paper triage, reading state, living documents, and report
snapshots no longer share the Project overview surface.

A project source binding whose `extraction_policy_json.profile_key` is
`academic_paper_v1` materializes matching academic-provider source items into a
paper object (`space_objects` + `sources` + `academic_papers`, deduped per
space by DOI, arXiv, OpenAlex, and Semantic Scholar ids) before the normal Project Corpus sync runs — see
`materializeAcademicPaperFromSourceItem`
(`server/src/modules/academic/paperMaterializer.ts`). Once
`source_items.source_object_id` is set, the object is picked up by the
existing corpus/graph sync with no preset-specific wiring.

The `project_research` module (`/api/v1/projects/{id}/research/*`, see below)
adds a project-owned research workflow foundation on top of Project Corpus:
research profile state for the general workflow API, workflow/stage/checkpoint
state, Artifact-per-stage links, project screening criteria, and a
literature-matrix read model. The general workflow-start endpoint may require
an approved profile, while the Auto Research initial-intake endpoint collects
its own research question and execution selection in one explicit setup action.
Editing an approved research profile returns it to `draft` for general
workflow consumers. The module dispatches through existing Runs/Artifacts
rather than a parallel execution system. Its integrity gate writes an
`integrity_report` Artifact and a pending checkpoint after checking
workflow-scoped claim links for missing citations, missing evidence or
explicit gaps, evidence outside the project corpus, and missing experiment
provenance.

### Research Workspace

`/projects/:projectId/research` is the project-owned workspace for three living
research documents plus immutable report snapshots:

- `research_notebooks` owns one notebook per project. Its fixed
  `research_notebook_sections` rows (`understanding`, `questions`, `ideas`,
  `experiments`) store canonical Tiptap JSON, server-derived normalized text and
  hash, and an optimistic version. Reader resolves a section id as document type
  `research_notebook`, so ordinary annotations and hash-mismatch behavior apply.
- the Reading List is a Project Corpus read model joined to
  `research_paper_cards`. A deep-analysis run resolves
  `project_research.paper_card`, creates the initial WHY/HOW/WHAT card directly,
  and records run/prompt provenance. Once a person edits a card, AI
  regeneration never overwrites it.
- `research_checklist_items` is the ordered progress document. People use CRUD
  directly; synthesis ideas/limitations and integrity alerts add
  `origin='agent'` items directly, dismissable like any other item.

AI writes to the notebook are direct co-edits, not proposals (revised D2).
Every write path — user save, seeding, monitoring, ad-hoc analysis, rollback —
goes through `notebookWriteService.writeNotebookSection`, which bumps the
optimistic version and records a full-content row in
`research_notebook_section_revisions` (source, block-op diff, user/run
attribution). AI edits are expressed as block-level ops (`append` / `insert` /
`replace` / `delete` against top-level Tiptap blocks), so untouched blocks are
carried over byte-identical and user formatting survives. The UI highlights the
latest AI edit with its diff and offers one-click rollback; restoring any
revision writes a new version, so history is never destroyed. An ad-hoc run
whose base version was overtaken degrades to a clearly labeled append instead
of merging blindly.

The first completed synthesis seeds only empty version-1 notebook sections.
Later report snapshots never overwrite evolved sections; legacy projects with
reports but no notebook are seeded from the latest non-rejected report on first
workspace initialization. The Ask-AI entry is separately budgeted: at most
`RESEARCH_ADHOC_DAILY_RUN_LIMIT` `research.adhoc_analyze` runs per project per
UTC day, enforced at queue time. Its output contract is a `notebook_update` ops
document applied by the research reconciler on run completion. `POST
.../research/reports` queues a `synthesis_only` operation over the current
reviewed corpus to create a new immutable snapshot.

Notebook sections also persist referenced source-item ids. Applied AI updates
merge their `refs` into that durable set, so integrity monitoring audits the
papers the living understanding actually depends on instead of inferring
citations from prose.

### Automatic academic research lifecycle

Initial intake starts with a stateless, managed-Provider question-refinement
interaction. The client may carry at most three rounds of clarification; the
server evaluates answerability plus FINER dimensions and returns bounded
rewrites, sub-questions, scope, and clarification prompts. Refinement is a
hard start gate: discovery and initial intake stay disabled until the assessment
passes (answerable with mean FINER score at least 3) or the user adopts one of
the bounded suggested rewrites. Drafts may still be saved before the gate
passes; the legacy-named `question_refine_skipped` state field records whether
the gate is still outstanding. Saving or starting intake makes the submitted research question the project's
`current_focus`, so the durable workflow snapshot and the question-drift guard
cannot diverge immediately after a rewrite is adopted.

Source discovery is owned by the `research` module. `POST
/api/v1/research/engine/search` resolves a bounded LLM query plan, previews the
supported academic providers and optionally policy-gated web search, merges
duplicate candidates, and persists the completed strategy in
`research_search_strategies`. `POST /api/v1/research/engine/monitors` is the
explicit confirmation boundary that transactionally creates the selected
Source Monitors and Project Source bindings. Web candidates and monitors are
marked untrusted and require a managed Source credential; secrets remain in the
trusted fetch channel. The attached strategy id follows the initial-intake
operation and its provider queries, hit counts, and failures are emitted in the
report limitations for reproducibility.

Automatic research uses a long-lived workflow plus a managed
`project_operations` execution. Baseline and incremental executions reuse the
same operation/step/link tables; progress JSON carries the run kind, query
fingerprint, source binding/rule/plan ids, watermark before/after, current
stage, checkpoint ids, and idempotency key. The orchestrator owns lifecycle and
recovery, while Sources owns fetching, pagination, post-processing cursors,
evidence materialization, and source policy.

Initial literature intake is saved independently as a `not_started` workflow
draft. Saving a draft persists the research question, attached search strategy, selected Source Monitors,
history scope, monitoring field, and execution selection without creating a
backfill plan or execution operation. A Source Monitor is the reusable query
configuration; intake discovery proposes monitors and the user explicitly
confirms which suggestions are created and bound. The project UI shows a compact intake summary and opens the full setup
editor only on request. A saved draft keeps explicit Edit setup and Start
research actions visible. Once the initial intake operation is created, the
setup summary is removed; runtime progress is shown by the operation, stage
status, artifacts, monitor state, and human-review checkpoints. Saving a draft
applies the returned workflow to the project page's local research state, so
unrelated project data is not reloaded. Initial intake execution resolves the
selected monitors and creates/reuses their project bindings; it does not create
an implicit query or duplicate monitor. Its history mode is either an explicit
bounded arXiv `from`/`to` range or an explicit `all_available` choice.
The latter freezes the current time as `to` and walks back to the arXiv safety
floor (`1991-01-01T00:00:00Z`); a max-item cap is partial rather than complete
and can be resumed from the persisted Source cursor only after the user
explicitly raises the item limit in Project Settings. Recovery actions never
choose or add an item budget.
Once a Project Research operation exists, its
`progress_json.history.max_items` is the sole writable budget authority;
project-owned Source backfill plans link to that operation and do not mirror
the total in `strategy_json`. Standalone Source backfill plans retain their
own plan-level budget. The research execution-profile service resolves the
selected Model Provider/model and
automatically reuses or provisions the system-managed research Agent/profile;
Research does not expose runtime adapter, CLI credential, Agent, or profile
overrides. It reuses or creates the selected monitor's project binding,
post-processing rule, and history plan. The user's explicit Start action
authorizes the history import for this Project Research operation; Auto Research
does not create a second `source_backfill_start` proposal. Generic Source and
agent-triggered history plans remain proposal-gated. After the history window
and post-processing drain, a `screening_gate` must be approved before synthesis.
The synthesis instruction is resolved through the Prompt Library asset
`project_research.synthesis` and its resolved version/hash are captured in the
Run contract. Synthesis output is schema-validated and must carry
source/evidence references;
intake also snapshots `report_depth=quick|full`. Quick reports are bounded to
five findings and skip the revision loop. Every valid synthesis draft is
reference-numbered and then receives a second managed
`synthesis_critique` run inside the synthesis stage. Critique results are
durable `research_critique` artifacts and are projected in
`progress_json.synthesis_critique`. A full report with a critical critique is
revised at most once; a second critical result, or any quick-report critical
result, is retained in report limitations with an unresolved marker. Only the
post-critique report is materialized into `project_research_reports` and moved
to `idea_review`. The periodic reconciler can recover an unqueued critique or
revision from operation state, preserving the level-triggered lifecycle.
it uses a standard result envelope: successful synthesis returns the required
artifacts, while an unactionable question or incoherent approved corpus returns
`status=rejected` with a machine-readable reason and user-facing suggestions;
that rejection is projected into the operation progress JSON so the caller can
correct the input and retry. Successful artifact `content` should be emitted as
a JSON object; the server still accepts legacy JSON-encoded strings and safely
normalizes a standalone JSON code fence before writing the text-backed artifact.
If inner artifact JSON or its protocol shape is invalid, the operation stores a
stable error code plus safe diagnostics (artifact id/type, length, SHA-256,
preview/tail, parser error and position where available), the run is marked
`degraded`, and a failed `validation_completed` run event is written. Full
artifact content remains available through the artifact record; logs only add a
bounded, redacted preview/tail for diagnosis. The operation and Run detail
views expose the same diagnostics, and the server emits a structured
`[project-research.synthesis] validation_failed` log line. An `idea_review` checkpoint is the final gate before
the source schedule is activated.

When a failed synthesis operation is retried, the retry clears the old
`synthesis_progress` snapshot and writes the new run id and queued/started
timestamps immediately. The workbench therefore does not have to wait for a
later reconciliation tick before showing the new attempt's age. While the run
is active, that read model also projects the linked `agent_run` job status,
attempt count, worker heartbeat/update timestamps, and latest run-event type.
The UI uses these fields to distinguish waiting for a worker, an active worker,
an old heartbeat, and a completed worker whose result has not yet been
reconciled. This is operational health/progress telemetry, not a model-generated
percentage: the synthesis agent does not currently emit a reliable inner-step
completion percentage. Project detail's Recent Runs list re-fetches canonical
run status while a project run or research operation is active, so it does not
retain a stale `running` badge after the run detail has reached a terminal
state. If the scheduler projection is still stale, the workbench offers a
repair-only reconcile action; it observes the terminal run and advances or
fails the operation without queuing a second run.
The state reader also recovers `synthesis_run_id` from the legacy
`synthesis_progress.run_id` location, so older projections remain repairable.

During screening, the operation's progress JSON also exposes a durable
`screening_progress` read model: total/classified/unclassified papers, batch
size, total/completed/active/failed batches, relevant/maybe/excluded counts,
missing-full-text and evidence counts, and a human-readable next-step message.
Each recovery batch updates this state when it starts and finishes, so the UI
can distinguish batch preparation, active screening, and a review-ready gate;
`running` alone is not the research progress contract.

After a bounded baseline is complete, `historical_backfill` creates a separate
managed operation against the same workflow, monitor bindings, and rules. It
rejects overlapping coverage and runs through the same explicit intake action,
screening, synthesis, and idea-review gates. While it runs, successful source
post-processing still materializes items but queues live items in the workflow;
the queue is flushed into one incremental operation after the historical
operation reaches a terminal review state. This keeps ingestion available while
preventing concurrent operations from overwriting workflow state.

Incremental runs are created by successful project-bound post-processing or an
explicit trigger after monitoring is active. A 48-hour overlap around the
stored `submittedDate`/`lastUpdatedDate` watermark protects against scan gaps,
while arXiv id/DOI/source-item dedupe keeps the corpus idempotent. After
incremental screening is approved, the managed `research.monitor_compare` pass
resolves `project_research.monitor_compare` and compares every relevant/maybe
paper with the current `understanding` section. It classifies each paper as
`supports`, `contradicts`, or `new_direction`, writes the stance and comparison
detail to the paper card and scan outcome, and completes without producing a
new formal report. Supporting evidence is recorded silently; contradictions
and new directions append one labeled, dated block to the `understanding`
section directly (a rollbackable `ai_monitoring` revision carrying source
refs). Formal synthesis remains an explicit report-snapshot action.

Every completed live scan has an append-only `research_scan_summaries` outcome
for each participating research workflow. Reconciliation-backed outcomes store
the scan window, completion time, new-item count, relevant/maybe/excluded
counts, comparison details, and supports/contradicts/new-direction counts; a
successful zero-item source scan also writes an explicit zero row.
Consequently the project timeline can distinguish "scanned, no updates" from
an absent day, which means no scan was recorded. Workflow and operation rows
remain mutable projections, while scan summaries are stable across later
question re-screening.

A separate daily `project_research_integrity_monitor` job checks DOI references
from accepted Notebook sections and non-rejected reports against the production
Crossref work record, including Retraction Watch `updated-by` metadata.
Retractions, corrections, expressions of concern, and reinstatements are
deduplicated in `research_integrity_alerts`. New events are pinned into the
daily scan digest, create a pending monitoring `integrity_gate`, and add an
agent-origin checklist item directly; repeated checks do not duplicate those
review obligations.

The editable project question (`projects.current_focus`) is compared with the
question snapshot in the active research workflow before any new judgement
run. If they differ, Auto Research source post-processing rules skip without
advancing their source cursor, post-processing reconciliation queues incoming
items instead of creating an old-question incremental operation, and explicit
incremental runs, historical extensions, failed-operation retries, and empty
backfill rescans return `409` until the drift is resolved. This protection also
applies to the automatic source-processing path, so changing the project
question cannot silently create new AI screening decisions under the old
question.

Question changes are resolved explicitly by a project writer. The workflow
keeps the latest and previous question/version; source-processing decisions
store `research_question_version` and remain append-only, and screening
coverage only counts decisions from the operation's version. The corpus read
model selects the newest decision per item/version while preserving every
human-confirmed `triage_status`.

`GET /projects/{id}/research/question/impact` reports affected paper/report
counts. `POST /projects/{id}/research/question/resolve` accepts `rescreen`,
`synthesis_only`, or `apply_forward`: all three refresh the profile and Auto
Research rule judgement fields; re-screen resets only unconfirmed AI corpus
projection and runs the normal screening/review/synthesis gates, synthesis-only
reuses the corpus and queues a new synthesis, and apply-forward leaves existing
decisions and artifacts unchanged. The older apply-forward endpoint delegates
to the same transaction. Active or queued research/source-processing work must
finish before resolution begins.

Operation progress is derived from the same effective stage used by the
operation steps. A failed operation retains its failed stage in
`progress_json.failed_stage`; the UI must render that stage as failed rather
than falling back to the sentinel `current_stage = failed`. The progress bar,
detail counters, and step indicator therefore remain consistent even when a
screening batch fails part way through.

The Project Research state authority has a level-triggered recovery invariant:
every research stage must be recoverable by the periodic reconciler from the
durable operation, workflow, source, checkpoint, and run tables alone. Event
hooks for source post-processing and terminal agent runs are latency
optimizations only; they enqueue a reconcile nudge and must not mutate
operation state. The reconciler observes those tables and applies the next
legal transition through the research state machine, so a lost hook cannot
stall an operation.

Research workflows may contain multiple Source Monitors for independent
scanning. The workflow stores channel ids, binding ids, query fingerprints,
per-channel coverage, and pending incremental channel events; it does not store
a provider-specific query as its source of truth. Monitor configuration remains
owned by Sources, while the workflow only records which monitors are included
and how their collected corpus participates in the research lifecycle.

### project_id on durable objects

The following tables carry `project_id` columns with database foreign keys to
`projects.id`. Unless noted otherwise, the column is nullable and existing rows
with `project_id = NULL` are unaffected.

| Table | Column added |
|---|---|
| `runs` | `project_id` |
| `activity_records` | `project_id` |
| `artifacts` | `project_id` |
| `proposals` | `project_id` |
| `memory_entries` | `project_id` |
| `automations` | `project_id` (composite FK `(space_id, project_id)`; optional, `agent_run` target only, requires project writer authority to bind — see [modules/automations.md](../modules/automations.md)) |
| `project_source_bindings` | `project_id` (required; composite FK `(space_id, project_id)`; source consumption requires project writer authority) |
| `project_source_item_links` | `project_id` (required; materialized Source item collection rows for project source bindings) |
| `project_corpus_items` | `project_id` (required; project-owned corpus/read model over object, source item, and evidence links) |

`project_source_bindings` and `project_source_item_links` are Project-owned
consumption configuration/read-model records, authored in
`server/src/db/schema/projectSources.ts` and served by the Projects module.
`source_connections` stay space-scoped under Sources. The binding is the
project boundary: the same source connection can be bound to multiple projects
because the uniqueness constraint includes `(space_id, project_id,
source_connection_id, binding_key)`.

`project_corpus_items` is Project-owned. It reconciles Sources output into the
project's working corpus:

- `status` is link lifecycle (`active` / `archived`);
- `triage_status` is the project-level judgement (`new`, `relevant`, `maybe`,
  `excluded`, `included`);
- `triage_confirmed_by_user` is set whenever a human explicitly sets
  `triage_status` through the Corpus API. Automated screening-decision sync
  (`syncProjectCorpusSourceDecisions`) must not overwrite `triage_status` or
  `last_reviewed_at` once this is true — AI screening only suggests, the user
  confirms;
- `read_status` is project-level reading progress (`unread`, `skimmed`,
  `read`, `discussed`).

When the corpus item's object is a materialized academic paper (see above),
the corpus DTO's `object.academic` field carries joined `academic_papers` +
`sources` metadata (`arxiv_id`, `doi`, `publication_date`, `venue`,
`paper_type`, citation counts, `authors`, `categories`, `source_uri`); it is
`null` for non-paper objects.

`source_post_processing_item_decisions` remains the source-item-level
post-processing decision/audit record. Project corpus rows may point at the
latest relevant decision through `source_decision_id`, but project triage/read
state is not stored on source items and does not mutate Library state.

One synthesis run atomically materializes one `project_research_reports` row and
one hidden `research_report.archive.v1` Artifact. Reports are readable while
`awaiting_review`; idea approval moves them to `complete`, rejection to
`rejected`. Literature matrix and integrity archives are explicit report FKs.
Historical Artifact links and synthesis Artifact list routes do not exist.

## project_id query filter on durable object list APIs

All five durable object list endpoints accept an optional `project_id` query parameter to scope results to a project:

| Endpoint | Parameter added |
|---|---|
| `GET /activity` | `project_id` |
| `GET /artifacts` | `project_id` |
| `GET /proposals` | `project_id` |
| `GET /runs` | `project_id` |
| `GET /memory` | `project_id` |

**Isolation guarantee:** Before filtering, each endpoint validates the requested
project with `assertProjectInSpace(db, space_id, project_id)`, returning HTTP 422
if the project does not exist in the requesting space or has been deleted. This
prevents cross-space enumeration via a guessed project ID. Durable writes that
accept a `project_id` also validate the association: Activity create, Run create,
and runtime materialized proposals reject missing/deleted/cross-space projects
before persisting rows. Runtime proposal materialization also canonicalizes the
proposal payload `project_id` and the `proposals.project_id` column to the same
validated value. Proposal apply carries `proposals.project_id` into
`memory_entries.project_id` only after revalidating the project in the proposal
space.

**Output schemas:** Each corresponding output schema (`ActivityOut`, `ArtifactOut`, `ProposalOut`, `RunOut`, `MemoryOut`, `ActivityRecordOut`) now includes `project_id: Optional[str] = None`. Rows without a project are not affected.

**Frontend:** All five `*Api.list()` functions in `api/client.ts` accept `project_id`. `ProjectDetailPage` uses these to render per-section scoped previews (up to 5 items each) with "View all →" links to the global list.

## Access control

- Project access is scoped by `space_id`. A user can only access projects within their active space.
- Cross-space workspace linking is rejected: linking a workspace from a different space returns 404.
- Project memory ACL is separate from high-level project visibility:
  `project_members` gates concrete `memory_entries.project_id` reads, while
  `project_public_summaries` is an approved, sanitized, space-public discovery
  layer.
- Project metadata/public-summary/workspace-link mutations require project
  writer authority: the project `owner_user_id`, a space `owner`/`admin`, or an
  active `project_members.role` of `owner` or `member`. `viewer` is read-only for
  concrete project memory and cannot mutate project metadata or public summary.
- Project source binding creation requires project writer authority and binds a
  Source Monitor directly to a Project. Removing project-workspace links does
  not mutate project source bindings.
- Project Detail shows a compact Sources summary and links to the Project
  Sources surface. Project Sources supports binding sources, backfill, scan,
  pause/remove, health, and the materialized project item collection. Global
  Sources remains the source-level management surface.
- Project Chat at `/projects/{id}/chat` reuses the normal agent chat/session
  and managed Run pipeline. Sessions and Runs carry validated `project_id`;
  reusing a session under another Project is rejected. Managed Project Chat
  exposes proposal-only source actions and stores structured action previews
  on assistant-message metadata for inline cards and canonical Review links.
- Project creation lets the user choose a Project preset. Project Detail uses
  the chosen preset to render the corresponding project shell. Academic Research
  projects show a research workbench and direct literature/corpus/citation graph
  operations. The preset does not create a second Project hierarchy.
- Project Detail also shows recent Sources recommendations from project-linked
  source post-processing decisions. These are selected/maybe candidate items for
  review and follow-up; accepting durable Knowledge still goes through proposal
  review.
- **Publishing a public summary** (`review_status` other than `draft`) requires
  project-**owner**-level authority — the project `owner_user_id` or a space
  `owner`/`admin`. A project `member` (writer) can stage drafts but cannot
  self-approve. The draft generator only ever writes `draft`. This gives the
  project owner a review gate before content becomes space-public.
- `settings_json` is free-form per-project configuration and may carry private
  operational detail. `GET /projects` and `GET /projects/{id}` redact it to
  `null` for non-writers; only project writers see it. `name`, `description`,
  and `current_focus` remain space-visible descriptive metadata.
- Project public-summary search is restricted to retrieval object type
  `project_public_summary`. It does not expose project memory, artifacts, docs,
  memo bodies, or other concrete project content.
- Approved public summaries also feed the **system chat candidate collector**
  (source `project_public_summary`), so the shared assistant can surface
  cross-project inspiration. Only the sanitized summary is read; concrete
  project memory stays behind its own ACL.
- **Database-level space/project consistency:** `projects` carries a composite
  candidate key `UNIQUE (space_id, id)`, and `project_public_summaries` and
  `project_members` carry a composite FK `(space_id, project_id) → projects
  (space_id, id)`. A summary or ACL row therefore cannot reference a project in
  another space even via hand-written SQL.

## Non-goals

- Project is not a task manager. Use the Task Board for work items.
- Project does not auto-promote artifacts into memory or knowledge.
- Project is not a Knowledge type; KnowledgeItem rows may reference `project_id`
  as a contextual association only.
- Project public summaries are not a substitute for project memory ACL; they are
  a sanitized discovery layer.
- Research, paper, author, citation, or literature tables are not part of Project.
# Project operations

`project_operations` is a Projects-owned grouping/read model over canonical
Runs, Jobs, Proposals, Artifacts, source bindings, and history-import plans.
It never executes or blocks those objects. Ordered optional steps provide a
product progress view; status and `progress_json` are projected from validated,
same-space links when an operation is read. Public routes live under
`/api/v1/projects/{projectId}/operations`; cancellation changes only the
operation grouping record and never cancels linked execution objects.
