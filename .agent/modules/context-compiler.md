# Module: Context Compiler

## Purpose
Translate a ContextPackage into a CLI-specific instruction file written to the sandbox. Security scanning, token budgeting, trust labels, and routing-manifest-driven `.agent/` doc loading happen here.

## Owns
- `ContextCompiler` class, `TargetFormat` enum, `CompiledContext` dataclass
- Security scanning of all content before inclusion (via `server/src/modules/context/compiler.ts`)
- Token/character budget enforcement (128k chars default, priority-ordered truncation)
- Trust label annotation per section (`[system]`, `[user]`, `[workspace]`, etc.)
- DB-authoritative Context Profiles (`context_profiles`) for Space/Project/Workspace/Agent/User context packs and routing manifests
- Progressive `.agent/` doc loading (default docs plus routing-manifest matches from touched TS/web/protocol paths)
- Vendor file header marking files as generated, not source of truth
- Agent Persona Prompt (`SOUL.md`) generation from agent-scoped identity memories
- Sandbox hook scripts (PostToolUse docs-sync reminders)
- Explicit artifact-backed context attachments selected by
  `context_artifact_ids`; the compiler consumes resolved attachments and does
  not run retrieval itself.

## Target → File Mapping

| Target | File(s) written |
|---|---|
| `claude` | `CLAUDE.md` + Agent Persona Prompt sidecar (`SOUL.md`, if agent identity present) |
| `codex` | `AGENTS.md` |
| `cursor` | `.cursorrules` |
| `generic` | `CONTEXT.md` |
| `soul` | Agent Persona Prompt (`SOUL.md`) |
| `prompt` | `prompt.md` |

## Section Priority (lower = kept first when budget exceeded)

| Priority | Section | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Task | task_goal, always present |
| 1 | System Policy | system-scoped memories |
| 2 | User Context | user-scoped memories |
| 3 | Project Docs | `.agent/` root docs |
| 4 | Project Context | workspace + capability memories |
| 5 | Agent Context | agent-scoped memories |
| 6 | Module Docs | `.agent/modules/*.md`, task-relevant only |
| 7 | Attached Context | resolved ContextAttachments |
| 8 | Recent Activity | episodic memories |
| 9 | Session History | session summaries |
| 10–14 | Tools, Sandbox, Validation, Constraints, Output | compile() args |

## Integration

```
ContextBuilder.build(attachments=[...], workspace_path=...) → ContextPackage
     ↓
ContextCompiler.compile(context, target, task_goal, sandbox_dir,
                         workspace_path, touched_files, routing_manifest)
     ↓
{sandbox_dir}/CLAUDE.md  (or AGENTS.md etc.)
{sandbox_dir}/SOUL.md    (Agent Persona Prompt sidecar, if agent identity present)
{sandbox_dir}/.claude/settings.json + hooks/check-docs-sync.sh
```

## Context Profiles And Routing Manifest

`context_profiles` is the authority for editable context workspace configuration.
Profiles are scoped by `space`, `project`, `workspace`, `agent`, or `user`, with
JSON object fields:

- `context_pack_json` — startup/context-pack metadata such as title, notes,
  observation policy, and whether the skill index should be exposed.
- `routing_manifest_json` — explicit routing rules from repo paths to `.agent`
  docs and optional bundle ids.

`ContextPrepareService` loads Space, Project, Workspace, Agent, and User
profiles for the run, merges them with `DEFAULT_CONTEXT_ROUTING_MANIFEST`, and
passes the effective manifest into `ContextCompiler`. The compiler no longer
routes by legacy Python basenames such as `models.py`, `schemas.py`, or
`context_builder.py`; it matches explicit path globs such as
`server/src/modules/context/**`, `server/src/gateway/routeRegistry.ts`,
`packages/protocol/src/**`, and `apps/web/src/modules/**`.

Routing manifests may only reference `.agent/*.md|yaml|yml` paths. Absolute
paths, `..`, and non-`.agent` docs are ignored/rejected by the manifest
normalizer. The generated `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, generated runtime skill
files, and hook files remain adapter outputs written into the sandbox only. They
are not an import path back into Memory, Knowledge, Capability, or the real
workspace.

## Explicit artifact attachments

`POST /api/v1/context/build` and managed run creation accept
`context_artifact_ids` (max 8). `PgRunContextRepository.selectArtifactAttachments`
resolves the selected artifacts for the current Space/User and only allows
bounded evidence packs from these artifact types:

- `retrieval_brief`
- `retrieval_eval_report`
- `retrieval_explain_report`
- `retrieval_maintenance_report`
- `memory_maintenance_report`

The repository verifies artifact visibility and project access, renders a
bounded summary, preserves a domain label, and marks the pack as
`content_mode = "bounded_summary"` with
`raw_artifact_content_included = false`. Missing, hidden, unsupported, or
project-inaccessible artifacts become blocked attachment entries with rejection
reasons. Approved and blocked entries are recorded in `ContextPackage.attachments`
and `ContextSnapshot.source_refs_json` / `retrieval_trace_json`; approved
artifact evidence-pack refs are also included in
`ContextSnapshot.included_evidence_refs_json` so audit consumers that track
"what entered context" do not miss explicit artifact packs.

`ContextPrepareService` appends approved attachments to the dynamic tail used by
managed runs. The stable prefix/digest layer does not consume attachments, and
retrieval results are never silently injected without explicit artifact ids.
Run creation performs an early visibility/type/project check for selected
artifact ids, but prepare-time revalidation remains authoritative because
artifact visibility can change while a run is queued. `/context/build` validates
the response with `ContextPackageSchema` before returning it.
Past snapshots are immutable audit records; future-run removal is represented by
not selecting the artifact id for the next context build.

Attachment content is intentionally a summary surface. `retrieval_explain_report`
attachments render selected aggregate fields such as diagnostic codes, target
type/status/returned state, score/rank, matched fields, and short reasons; they
do not stringify the stored target/match JSON. `retrieval_brief` attachments can
include the saved brief query/answer because selection is explicit and
owner/user-visible, so callers should treat attached brief metadata as
model-visible context.

## ContextDigest cache layer

`ContextPrepareService` tries to load active `ContextDigest` rows before rendering the stable prefix.

- A digest is only injected as a `[digest:<type>:v<N>]` block in `stable_prefix` (replacing direct policy/memory rendering for that section) when it is **usable**: for workspace/agent memory digests, the run agent's `readable_scopes` includes that scope **and** it is `active` **and** every claimed `source_memory_ids_json` entry still passes live revalidation for its scope (same space + scope, active, undeleted, shared, non-`highly_restricted`).
- A digest is **dropped** (and its scope falls back to direct `MemoryRetriever` / direct active policies) when it is missing, out-of-scope for the agent's `readable_scopes`, `dirty`, or — for memory digests — has any stale/ineligible claimed source. The cached summary is a blended, non-redactable artifact, so a single stale source drops the whole digest. This is the read-side fail-safe: it prevents a pending change, a stale/tampered row, or a `readable_scopes` bypass (the digest is a derived view of the same memory the retriever gates) from leaking content into the prompt.
- Workspace/agent digests cover only cache-safe shared memory. Per-user gated memory that is visible for the current run is still rendered directly and is not folded into the shared digest.
- `ContextSnapshot.source_refs_json` includes `context_digest` entries (recording `source_memory_ids`, `source_policy_ids`, `source_relation_ids`) **only for usable digests** — a dropped digest contributes no trace, so refs never record unvalidated or leaked source ids. Digest does not replace source traceability.
- `ContextSnapshot.retrieval_trace_json` records `digest_used`, `digest_types`, `digest_versions`, `digest_dropped` (`[{digest_type, reason}]` with reason `dirty`|`stale_source_memory`|`scope_not_readable`), `digest_missing_types`, and `fallback_to_memory_retriever`.
- Digest source memory injection writes memory access logs only for the revalidated source ids of usable digests that were not already logged by the per-run retriever.
- Execution is never blocked by a missing, dirty, or dropped digest — it falls back to direct rendering.

### ContextDigest principles
- `ContextDigest` is a derived cache — not Memory, not Policy, not a source of truth.
- Digest does not create Proposal. Digest can be deleted and regenerated.
- Digest summarises active approved Memory/Policy only (no unapproved proposal content).
- Supported `digest_type` values: `policy_bundle`, `workspace`, `agent`.
- Personal Radius / external sources are out of scope.

### Digest scoping, invalidation & lifecycle
- Digests are **peer-level**: each digest summarises exactly one scope and never folds another level in. `policy_bundle` holds all active space policies; `workspace`/`agent` hold only that scope's own active memory. A policy is never embedded in workspace/agent digests, and agent config (system prompt, model, policies) is never embedded in the agent digest — those reach a run directly at consumption time, where `loadDigestBundle` assembles `policy_bundle + workspace + agent` for the run.
- Workspace/agent digests are **shared-only**: `loadScopeMemories` filters `visibility IN ('space_shared','workspace_shared')` (agent: `space_shared` only) and excludes `highly_restricted`. This is a privacy gate — private/per-user memory never enters a cache-shared bundle and is rendered directly per run instead. Space-scoped (`scope_type='space'`) memory has no digest tier and always falls back to the retriever.
- Invalidation is **content-driven**: only a change to a digest's own content marks it dirty. A memory change marks its own scope's workspace/agent digest (via `affectedDigestTargets`); a policy change marks only `policy_bundle`. Triggers that do not alter a digest's content must not mark it dirty (a no-op refresh).
- Dirty-marking takes the **same** per-digest `pg_advisory_xact_lock` key as generation (`digestLockKey.*`), inside the proposal-apply transaction. This serializes mark-vs-refresh: otherwise a refresh that already read the old sources could observe the freshly-marked-dirty row, find its `source_hash` unchanged against the stale read, and flip it back to `active` — resurfacing a stale digest as injectable.
- `POST /api/v1/context/digests/refresh` has two modes: an **explicit** body `{scope_type, digest_type, scope_id?}` generates/bootstraps that one digest (creating the first version if none exists); an **empty** body runs `refreshAllDirty`, which only re-generates already-dirty digests and does not bootstrap. Use the explicit form to create a space's first digest. Missing digests are otherwise created lazily by the `context_digest_refresh` job enqueued on the first relevant change.
- Lifecycle: when a scope is archived (`DELETE /api/v1/workspaces/:id` soft-archives), the archive status update and the `disabled`-ing of its `active`/`dirty` digests run in **one transaction**, so a failure to disable rolls back the archive (never leaves an archived scope with a loadable digest). Generation locks the scope row `FOR UPDATE` and re-checks `status='active'` before insert, so it cannot race the archive into re-creating an `active` digest for an archived scope. Agents currently have no delete path. Disabling frees the `uq_context_digests_current_scope` slot.

## Invariants
- Vendor files are never written to the real workspace
- Markdown/vendor files are not authoritative memory or routing state; DB
  profiles and approved Memory/Knowledge/Capability rows are authoritative
- Changes agents make to generated files do not propagate to active memory
- Compiled content (prefix + tail) is stored in `ContextSnapshot` columns for audit
- Snapshot population failure blocks adapter execution
- Missing digest never blocks execution; populator falls back gracefully
