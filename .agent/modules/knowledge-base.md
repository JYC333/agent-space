# Module: Knowledge Base

## Status
**BACKEND + FRONTEND MVP IMPLEMENTED** — Knowledge is the first-level product module
(it replaced the old first-level "Wiki"). Backend has the canonical schema,
`/api/v1/knowledge` API, and proposal apply handlers. Frontend: `/knowledge` is a thin
entry that redirects to the last-used workspace (default `/knowledge/notes`);
`/knowledge/home` is an **optional** overview hub, never the forced landing. Sub-areas
(Notes / Wiki / Sources / Cards) switch via an in-header breadcrumb switcher
(`Knowledge / Notes ▼`) — there is **no** Knowledge scene sidebar or tab strip, so each
workspace owns its own layout. Notes is a working-knowledge workspace (configurable
collection tree + open-note tabs, create / edit + links/backlinks); Wiki is the KnowledgeItem browser under
`/knowledge/wiki`; Sources lists evidence; Cards is a clean placeholder. The backend
already supports source list/create/get/update/archive and item-source link CRUD;
the current web client exposes Sources as list-only evidence browsing. Automatic
generation, assessments, card generation, and richer search remain future work.

### Frontend information architecture
- **Knowledge** is first-level; **Notes** are working knowledge; **Wiki** is powered by
  `KnowledgeItem`; **Sources** and **Cards** are Knowledge sub-areas.
- `/knowledge` opens the last-used workspace by default (Notes on a fresh client); the
  overview is reached intentionally at `/knowledge/home`, not forced on every visit.
- Cross-section navigation is the breadcrumb switcher in `KnowledgeSectionHeader`
  (last-used section persisted via `rememberKnowledgeSection`, excluding `home`).
- The Notes collection tree is **local to the Notes workspace** and loaded from the backend,
  never a third-level global nav tier. PARA (Inbox / Projects / Areas / Resources / Archive)
  is only the default initialization template for a space. The open note nests at
  `/knowledge/notes/:noteId` so the tree + tabs stay mounted while switching notes.

## Purpose
**Knowledge** is the unified, human-browsable long-term content module. It is split
into subdomains by *lifecycle*, not just by view:

- **Notes** — *working knowledge*: evolving meeting/design/research/thinking notes,
  edited freely via direct CRUD (no proposal gate). Table `notes`.
- **Wiki** — *canonical knowledge*: stable concepts, definitions, structured pages,
  graph relations and evidence. Review-gated and versioned. Table `knowledge_items`.
- **Sources** — external references / evidence. Table `sources`.
- **Cards** — review/learning artifacts derived from Notes/Wiki/Sources.
  Space-scoped content (`cards`); user-specific scheduling state (`card_review_states`);
  append-only review history (`card_reviews`). FSRS algorithm implementation deferred.

Notes and Wiki are **related but not the same**: Wiki is not merely a different view
of Notes. The working/canonical split is the reason they are separate models — folding
freely-editable notes into the proposal-governed `knowledge_items` table would break
its "everything here was reviewed" guarantee, so Notes get their own lightweight model.

Capture / Activity is *raw material* upstream of all of this and is not Knowledge.

Backend and API naming uses `knowledge`; space-specific product labels are
presentation concerns. Knowledge is distinct from Memory: Memory is agent
context; Knowledge is durable content for people to inspect, revise, relate, and reuse.

No removed route or compatibility alias exists. The API path is `/api/v1/knowledge`;
canonical table names are `space_objects`, `notes`, `note_collections`,
`note_collection_items`, `knowledge_items`, `sources`,
`knowledge_item_sources`, `claims`, `claim_sources`, and `object_relations`.
Wiki proposal types use `knowledge_*`, claim proposal types use `claim_*`,
object relation proposal types use `object_relation_*`, and
`claim_candidate_packet` is the review packet bridge from retrieval artifacts
into child claim/object-relation proposals
(notes are not proposal-gated).

## Layers

| Layer | Table | Write path | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SpaceObject** | `space_objects` | owned by concrete object write path | shared space-scoped object root for common metadata |
| **Note** | `notes` | direct CRUD | working knowledge that evolves freely |
| **NoteCollection** | `note_collections` | direct CRUD | space-scoped folder tree for organizing notes |
| **KnowledgeItem** (Wiki) | `knowledge_items` | proposal → approval | canonical, versioned knowledge |
| **Source** | `sources` | direct CRUD | provenance / evidence |
| **KnowledgeItemSource** | `knowledge_item_sources` | direct CRUD | wiki item ↔ source evidence |
| **Claim** | `claims` | proposal → approval | global semantic atom attached to `space_objects` |
| **ClaimSource** | `claim_sources` | proposal → approval with claim writes | claim ↔ evidence/source-policy path |
| **ObjectRelation** | `object_relations` | proposal → approval | canonical FK-backed cross-object graph over `space_objects` |
| **Card** | `cards` | direct CRUD (future) | space-scoped review card derived from knowledge objects |
| **CardReviewState** | `card_review_states` | scheduler-written (future) | per-user FSRS scheduling state; one row per (card, user) |
| **CardReview** | `card_reviews` | append-only (future) | per-user review history with rating + state snapshot |

Notes on the wiki layers: `source` is **not** a KnowledgeItem type — it is the `sources`
table. `answer` **is** a canonical KnowledgeItem type (a `question` item and its `answer`
item are linked with a generic `related_to` relation; there is no dedicated `answers`
relation type). `ObjectRelation` is the governed cross-object graph;
`KnowledgeItemSource` is item↔source evidence; the two must not be conflated.
`ProvenanceLink` records accepted lineage into memory/policy/knowledge targets.

Wiki pages read canonical backlinks through `object_relations`. Notes also expose
direct working-note links through `note_links`; those links are not canonical graph
authority and are not projected into retrieval edges.

### Notes vs Collections

Collections/folders are organization *views*, not sole ownership, and a note may appear
in many. The `note_collections` tree is space-scoped and user-configurable; PARA is seeded
only as the initial folder template. A note still belongs to global Knowledge, never to a
separate per-project note system.

`note_collection_items` stores `space_id` and uses composite foreign keys to ensure
collections and notes belong to the same space. `note_collections.parent_id` is also
constrained by `(parent_id, space_id)` so folder trees cannot cross spaces.

## Owns
- `Note` model (working-knowledge layer; direct CRUD via `NoteService`)
- `NoteCollection` / `NoteCollectionItem` models (space-scoped Notes folder tree)
- `KnowledgeItem` model (canonical wiki layer)
- `Source` model (independent provenance/evidence layer)
- `KnowledgeItemSource` model (item↔source evidence links)
- `ObjectRelation` model (proposal-gated canonical cross-object graph)
- `NoteLink` model (`note_links`, direct working-note UI links)
- `KnowledgeSummaryService` (Overview counts)
- `/api/v1/knowledge` read and proposal API for wiki items; `/api/v1/knowledge/notes`
  + `/api/v1/knowledge/notes/{id}/links|backlinks` direct CRUD for notes;
  `/api/v1/notes/collections` direct CRUD for the Notes collection tree;
  `/api/v1/knowledge/sources` direct CRUD; `/api/v1/knowledge/items/{id}/sources`
  item-source link CRUD; `/api/v1/knowledge/claims/candidate-packets`;
  `/api/v1/knowledge/summary`
- Knowledge proposal apply handlers for wiki, claim/object-relation writes, and
  Claim Candidate Packets
- Object Schema Registry / object-kind registry routes and appliers:
  owner/admin proposal routes for `object_kind_create`, `object_kind_update`
  (including draft activation), `object_kind_deprecate`, and
  `object_kind_archive`; member-visible registry reads; object-schema
  export/import; and deterministic object-schema suggestion scans. These routes
  and appliers write only registry rows/proposals/artifacts, never canonical
  Knowledge, Memory, Claim, Project, relation, or retrieval projection rows.
- Frontend Knowledge module (breadcrumb switcher, Notes workspace, Wiki/Sources/Cards, overview hub) under `apps/web/src/modules/knowledge/`
- Relation and evidence-link records backed by database rows, not only Markdown links

### Current Sources frontend

Backend source capability is ahead of the visible frontend: `knowledge` routes
support source CRUD and item-source link CRUD, but `apps/web/src/api/client.ts`
currently exposes `sourcesApi.list` only and `SourcesPage` is a list view. Treat
this as current product scope, not as missing backend support.

## Does Not Own
- Raw capture (activity module)
- Agent runtime output storage (runs/artifacts modules)
- Long-term agent context injection (memory module)
- Project taxonomy or workspace structure
- Spaced repetition scheduling
- Feynman or Reflection assessment dialogue flows

## Knowledge vs Memory

| Aspect | Memory | Knowledge |
|---|---|---|
| Primary audience | Agent context | Human browsing and review |
| Runtime use | Eligible for ContextBuilder | Must not automatically enter ContextBuilder |
| Shape | Scoped context entry | Typed item with versioning and relations |
| Write path | Proposal -> approval -> active memory | Proposal -> approval -> active KnowledgeItem |
| Promotion | N/A | Future separate proposal, e.g. `knowledge_promote_to_memory` |

Knowledge items must not be auto-injected into runtime context. Promoting Knowledge into Memory is a separate future flow and is not part of the Knowledge MVP scaffold.

## Retrieval Substrate

Knowledge is the first consumer of the shared retrieval engine
(`server/src/modules/retrieval/`), registering a domain adapter
(`knowledge/retrievalAdapter.ts`) for `KnowledgeItem`, `Note`, `Source`, and
`Claim`. The engine is generic and domain-agnostic; the adapter owns all
Knowledge-specific SQL and the visibility revalidation gate. See
[CONTEXT_AND_RETRIEVAL_LAYER.md](../architecture/CONTEXT_AND_RETRIEVAL_LAYER.md)
for the engine/adapter boundary and the full retrieval + context-layer
architecture. The Object Schema Registry foundation is also served from the
Knowledge module: `space_object_kinds` registry rows are read in the current
space, and owner/admin proposal routes create, update/activate, deprecate, or
archive object kinds through registered proposal appliers. The registry stores
bounded declarative field schemas, extraction hints, retrieval hints, relation
hints, and UI labels/config under fixed retrieval `object_type` values. Object
schema export/import serializes registry definitions; import creates draft
object-kind proposals and never activates definitions directly. This registry is
object schema config only; it does not add retrieval object types or write
canonical Knowledge, Memory, Claim, Project, relation, or retrieval projection
rows. Follow-up retrieval/context-layer quality work and non-goals are tracked in
[ROADMAP_AND_FUTURE_RISKS.md](../architecture/ROADMAP_AND_FUTURE_RISKS.md#retrieval-and-context-layer-stabilization).
Canonical lifecycle ownership does not change:
KnowledgeItem writes remain proposal-gated, Notes and Sources remain direct CRUD,
and retrieval projection rows are derived indexes that can be rebuilt from the
canonical tables.

The initial projection indexes:

- `KnowledgeItem` title, slug, aliases, content/plain text, excerpt, source URL,
  item status, visibility, owner, workspace, accepted object relations, and
  item-source evidence links.
- `Note` title, plain text, excerpt, status, workspace/project associations where
  present, and working `note_links` rows.
- `Source` title, URI, raw text, summary, status, and item-source links.
- `Claim` title, subject text, claim text, status, visibility, owner, claim
  relations, claim-source evidence links, and object relation edges. Final
  viewer-facing claim snippets after revalidation come from `claim_text` only.

Extracted markdown links, wikilinks, source references, and alias matches are
retrieval evidence or suggested retrieval edges only. They must not create an
accepted `ObjectRelation` unless a user accepts the existing object relation
proposal flow.

Create-safety is advisory duplicate detection for review and proposal creation:
`exists`, `probable_duplicate`, or `unknown`. It explains why a create may match
an existing object, but it does not make retrieval projection authoritative and
does not silently block canonical writes.

Full-space retrieval reindex is a maintenance operation exposed at
`POST /api/v1/knowledge/retrieval/reindex`. It rebuilds derived projection rows
for the caller's space and requires space owner/admin authority.

## Activity-First Input Boundary

Raw user input, session content, file imports, web captures, and run outputs enter Activity, Run, or Artifact first. Future Knowledge generation normally follows:

```
Activity / Run / Artifact
-> knowledge proposal
-> proposal acceptance
-> active KnowledgeItem / ObjectRelation
```

Agent-generated knowledge never becomes active without proposal approval.

## Knowledge Kinds

`KnowledgeItem.knowledge_kind` is restricted to these canonical Wiki kinds:

| Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `concept` | A definition, idea, or named concept |
| `lesson` | Learned principle or takeaway |
| `procedure` | Repeatable steps or operating procedure |
| `decision` | Decision record or rationale |
| `question` | Open question |
| `answer` | An answer to a `question` item (linked via `related_to`) |
| `summary` | Digest of an Activity, Run, Artifact, or Source |

`source`, `idea`, `experience`, and `reflection` are **not** canonical Wiki item types.
`source` is the `sources` table (provenance/evidence). Ideas, experiences, and
reflections are working-note / activity concepts and belong in **Notes** or **Activity**,
not the proposal-governed `knowledge_items` table. (Daily-capture "experience"
candidates land as canonical `summary` KnowledgeItems.)

The default `knowledge_kind` for the create proposal is `concept`. Some kinds may later
gate on assessment flows (e.g. a Feynman/Reflection gate); these are future and must not
block the MVP persistence/API slice.

## Proposal Types

- `knowledge_create` creates an active KnowledgeItem.
- `knowledge_update` creates a new version, not an in-place overwrite.
- `knowledge_archive` archives an item.
- `object_relation_create` creates a relation only within the same space.
- `object_relation_delete` removes or archives a relation.

These proposal types are supported by `ProposalApplyService`. They remain review-gated and are not direct-write API operations.

`knowledge_create` sets `owner_user_id` to the proposal creator for the MVP. The API does not expose selected owner/user assignment yet, so one user cannot create private or restricted Knowledge owned by another user.

Proposal creation is viewer-aware, and proposal apply performs defense-in-depth
authorization again. Malformed, internally seeded, or future system-created
proposals cannot update, archive, relate, or archive relations involving another
user's private or restricted Knowledge. Agent/run provenance is not treated as
human ownership authority for private or restricted Knowledge in the MVP.

## Read Visibility

Knowledge reads are viewer-aware:

- `space_shared` is readable by any authenticated member of the current space.
- `workspace_shared` is readable by any authenticated member of the current space for now. Workspace-role narrowing is future work.
- `private` is readable only by `owner_user_id`, or by `created_by_user_id` when no owner is set.
- `restricted` follows the same owner-only MVP rule as `private`.

Private or restricted rows with neither `owner_user_id` nor `created_by_user_id` fail closed for normal reads. Unauthorized reads return 404 and must not reveal existence.

`GET /api/v1/knowledge/items` returns summary rows with `content_preview`; `GET /api/v1/knowledge/items/{id}` returns full content.

Relation reads first require the requested item to be visible to the viewer, then omit any relation where either endpoint is not visible to the viewer.

Relation apply uses the same endpoint visibility authority: private or restricted
endpoints can only be used by their owner/creator, while shared endpoints remain
collaborative within the current space.

## Source Monitoring

Knowledge proposal apply currently relies on proposal approval and the `proposal.apply` policy gate. `ProposalApplyService._enforce_source_monitoring()` has an explicit Knowledge branch documenting that full Knowledge source monitoring is future work. External or untrusted Activity/Artifact-derived Knowledge requires a future evaluator and must not be treated as safe merely because the current branch does not block.

## Policy Actions

- `knowledge.create`
- `knowledge.update`
- `knowledge.archive`
- `knowledge.relation_create`
- `knowledge.relation_delete`
- `claim.create`
- `claim.update`
- `claim.archive`
- `claim.relation_create`
- `claim.relation_delete`
- `object_relation.create`
- `object_relation.delete`

These actions are `WIRED_VIA_PROPOSAL`: durable mutation is protected by `proposal.apply` and `ProposalApplyService`, not direct `PolicyGateway.enforce()` call sites. Unknown or not-yet-implemented Knowledge actions must fail closed.

## Project And Workspace Association

Project is not a Knowledge type. Workspace is not a Knowledge type. They are contextual associations.

KnowledgeItem rows may carry `project_id` and/or `workspace_id`, but the primary content model must not be a project tree taxonomy.

Relation creation must enforce same-space endpoints. `ObjectRelation` is the
proposal-gated semantic graph; `KnowledgeItemSource` is the item↔source evidence
layer; `note_links` is a direct working-note UI edge. The three must not be
conflated. Sources are evidence/raw material, so Source and KnowledgeItemSource use
direct CRUD (`/api/v1/knowledge/sources`, `/api/v1/knowledge/items/{id}/sources`)
rather than the proposal workflow that gates semantic KnowledgeItem and
ObjectRelation writes. A Source may point back to an
existing ActivityRecord via `source_activity_id` (or any other origin via
`content_ref` / `metadata_json`); ActivityRecord remains the raw capture layer and is
not replaced by Source.

> Frontend follow-up: Sources should surface as a Wiki sub-tab / evidence panel, not
> as ordinary wiki items.

## Invariants

- **Wiki** (canonical KnowledgeItem) durable writes go through proposals; agent-generated
  wiki knowledge never directly becomes active.
- **Notes** (working knowledge) are direct-CRUD and **not** proposal-gated; they are
  space-scoped and never auto-injected into Memory/ContextBuilder. Notes are not wiki:
  they do not version, carry verification/reflection status, or share the proposal path.
- `object_relations.from_object_id` / `to_object_id` are FK-backed
  `space_objects` endpoints in the same space, and an object cannot link to itself.
- **Card content** (`cards`) is space-scoped; any member of the space can see cards
  in that space. **Card review state** (`card_review_states`) and **review history**
  (`card_reviews`) are user-specific. `cards.source_id` is polymorphic (no FK;
  covered by `server/test/baselineSchema.test.ts`). The FSRS scheduling fields on
  `card_review_states` are nullable — a state row can be created before first review.
- Durable Knowledge writes go through proposals.
- Agent-generated Knowledge never directly becomes active.
- Private and restricted Knowledge reads are owner-only for the MVP.
- Knowledge does not automatically enter Memory or ContextBuilder.
- Knowledge promotion into Memory is a future explicit proposal flow.
- Activity, Run, and Artifact are raw/source inputs, not active Knowledge.
- Project and workspace are associations, not Knowledge content categories.
- Updates are versioned; active content is not overwritten in place.
- Relation rows are database-backed and same-space only.
- Backend/domain/API naming uses `knowledge`; frontend-specific labels are presentation-only.
- No removed-route compatibility is provided.
- No historical data migration compatibility is required.

**Enforced by tests:**
- `server/test/leafDomainInvariants.test.ts` — knowledge proposals do not auto-promote into memory and server proposal appliers own accepted knowledge mutations.
- `server/test/leafDomainRepositoryBehavior.test.ts` — repository behavior around leaf-domain proposal boundaries.
- Payload validation is enforced at apply time in `KnowledgeProposalApplier`: `knowledge_kind`, `content_format`, `visibility`, `verification_status`, `reflection_status`, and `confidence` for items; `relation_type`, `status`, and `confidence` for relations.

- `server/migrations/` - generated/applied SQL artifacts
- `server/test/` - live schema and API tests for Knowledge/Cards surfaces
- `server/src/modules/policy/` - Knowledge policy actions wired via proposal
- `server/src/gateway/routeRegistry.ts` - active backend module registry entry
- `apps/web/src/modules/knowledge/` - `KnowledgeModule` (index redirect + routes), `KnowledgeSectionHeader` (breadcrumb switcher), `utils.ts` (last-used section storage + canonical vocabularies), `KnowledgeOverviewPage` (`/knowledge/home`), `NotesPage` workspace + `NoteEditor`, `KnowledgePage`/`KnowledgeDetailPage` (Wiki), `SourcesPage`, `KnowledgeCardsPanel`
- `apps/web/src/core/navigation.tsx` - first-level "Knowledge" rail item only (Knowledge has **no** scene; sections switch via the in-header breadcrumb)
- `server/test/` - ingestion/review boundary and API contract tests

## Related Modules
- [../architecture/SOURCE_EVIDENCE_FOUNDATION.md](../architecture/SOURCE_EVIDENCE_FOUNDATION.md) - the two evidence stacks (source candidate vs curated wiki `Source`/`KnowledgeItemSource`), their hard separation, and the source→wiki promotion rule spec
- [memory.md](memory.md) - Memory is agent context, not the Knowledge browser
- [activity.md](activity.md) - raw input and source events
- [spaced-repetition.md](spaced-repetition.md) - future card generation from approved Knowledge
- [proposals.md](proposals.md) - proposal review and apply boundary

## TODO
- Notes: ProseMirror/Tiptap rich editor (schema already ProseMirror-ready), full link
  picker across all entity types, and richer collection management
- Note → Wiki promotion flow (create a `knowledge_create` proposal from a note,
  linked via `object_relations` `source_for`/`derived_from`)
- Plain-text/excerpt + search projection regeneration from `content_json`
- Later Feynman and Reflection assessments
- Automatic Activity/Artifact to Knowledge proposal generation
- Source monitoring evaluator for Knowledge proposals
- **Cards — next slice**: card generation workflow (from Notes/Wiki/Sources → Card rows),
  direct CRUD API under `/api/v1/knowledge/cards`, FSRS review scheduler, and the
  frontend review UI. Schema (cards / card_review_states / card_reviews) is in place.
