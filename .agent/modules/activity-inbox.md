# Module: Activity Inbox

## Status
**IMPLEMENTED** — model, service, and API routes live in `server/src/modules/activity/`.

## Purpose
Raw-input layer (L0). Everything entering the system lands as an `ActivityRecord` first — never directly as memory. External input must enter Activity before it can become memory.

## Owns
- `ActivityRecord` model
- `ActivityService` (CRUD, status transitions, source trust inference)
- Activity API routes
- Activity inbox UI (`ActivityInboxPage.tsx`)

## source_kind / source_trust Values

Canonical `source_kind` / `activity_type` values: `user_capture`,
`chat_message`, `external_chat`, `file_import`, `web_capture`, `run_event`,
`workspace_event`, `system_event`, `external_source`, and `source`. Legacy input
aliases such as `user_input`, `manual`, `agent_run`, `task_log`,
`imported_chat`, `file_capture`, and `voice_capture` are normalized at ingest.

Default `source_trust` by kind:
- `user_capture`, `chat_message`, `external_chat`, `file_import` → `user_confirmed`
- `run_event`, `system_event`, `workspace_event`, `source` → `internal_system`
- `web_capture`, `external_source` → `untrusted_external`
- Unknown/empty → `untrusted_external`

If `ActivityRecord.source_trust` is already set to a valid enum value, that value wins.

## Key Model

```
ActivityRecord:
  id, space_id, user_id, workspace_id, agent_id
  source_kind, source_trust, activity_type, title, content
  source_run_id, source_task_id, source_session_id, source_url
  subject_user_id
  aggregate_key       # nullable idempotency key for pointer/aggregate rows
  status (raw|processed|proposals_generated|failed|archived)
  payload_json, occurred_at, created_at, updated_at
```

## API Routes

```
POST   /api/v1/activity                    — ingest
GET    /api/v1/activity                    — list (filter: source_type, status, workspace)
GET    /api/v1/activity/{id}
PATCH  /api/v1/activity/{id}/review        — mark as reviewed (status-only; no proposals)
PATCH  /api/v1/activity/{id}/archive
POST   /api/v1/activity/{id}/consolidate   — run consolidation for this activity only (no body)
```

Batch / explicit ids: `POST /api/v1/memory/consolidation/run` with optional `activity_ids` and `batch_limit`.

## Flow

```
raw input → ActivityRecord (status=raw, source_trust assigned)
    → POST /activity/{id}/consolidate (or batch consolidation run)
        → Memory retrieval create-safety pre-dedupe
        → classifier → MemoryCandidateValidator → MemoryProposalProducer
        → reviewable Proposals created with provenance_entries
    → user approves proposals → ProposalApplyService writes MemoryEntry
    → ActivityRecord status updated
```

Daily Sources post-processing also emits pointer rows into Activity:

```
source_post_processing_run succeeded
    → upsert ActivityRecord(activity_type=source, aggregate_key=source:briefing:<source_connection_id>:<local_date>)
    → Inbox row opens /library/digests/:connectionId/:date
    → review/archive clears the notification without deleting Library content
```

These rows are notification pointers only. `payload_json` carries
`briefing_date`, `source_connection_id`, `post_processing_run_ids`,
`artifact_ids`, and `decision_counts`; `content` is a short preview, never the
full digest body. The per-source toggle is
`source_connections.config_json.daily_inbox_briefing`; when absent, emission is
enabled if the connection currently has at least one active post-processing
rule. Existing reviewed rows are re-surfaced to `raw` when a new run lands for
the same source local day.

Source recommendation rows are also pointers only: they open
`/sources?view=pending&connection_id=...`. Reviewing or archiving the pointer
does not change `source_connection_user_subscriptions`; Follow, Dismiss, Mute,
and Unsubscribe are handled by Sources.

## Invariants
- `ActivityRecord` is L0 raw event layer; it is not active Memory
- ActivityRecords become memory only through the Proposal → ProposalApplyService path
- `agent_inferred` activities cannot produce active semantic memory or policy without explicit user accept
- Activity-derived proposals carry Activity provenance in `provenance_entries`
  and may include `source_activity_id` as a pending-proposal compatibility
  shortcut
- Consolidation is idempotent: visible Memory duplicate checks run before proposal
  creation, and duplicate proposals are blocked by `proposal_dedupe_key`
- The Inbox holds pointers, never content (BOUNDARIES B24A). A module that
  wants user attention delivers a clearable notification row here; the
  content itself lives in that module's own reading surface (e.g. the
  Library reading surface at `/library` for Sources-derived digests and items).
  Do not grow Inbox detail rendering into a general-purpose reading UI.
  Pointer rows use `aggregate_key IS NOT NULL` and are excluded from
  Activity-to-Memory consolidation.
