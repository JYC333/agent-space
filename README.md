# agent-space

A space-based, multi-user, agent-first system for personal, family, and small team use.
The runtime target is **Linux / WSL / server + a browser UI**. By default agent runs are
isolated with **git worktrees** (plus `PathPolicy`) so file access is confined to the run's
workspace. Stronger one-shot Docker isolation is not wired into the current product path;
high/critical-risk execution that requires it fails closed instead of silently downgrading.
PostgreSQL is the only supported server database.

## Concept

```
One deployment instance
  ├── Personal Space
  ├── Family Space
  └── Team Space
```

Each space has its own users, workspaces, memories, permissions, agents, and tool access.

Runtime data (DB, config, secrets, logs, workspaces, sandboxes) never lives in the repo.
It lives under a host-side parent `ASPACE_ROOT` (default `~/.aspace`), one mode root per
environment: `$ASPACE_ROOT/dev`, `$ASPACE_ROOT/test`, `$ASPACE_ROOT/prod`. Each mode root
is bind-mounted into the containers as `AGENT_SPACE_HOME=/aspace`.
Local DB/system scripts use the same compose/env path as `ops/scripts/start.sh`: mode validation,
`$ASPACE_ROOT/<mode>`, `$ASPACE_ROOT/<mode>/.env`, `AGENT_SPACE_MODE_ROOT`, compose project,
and `docker compose --env-file ...` are centralized in `ops/scripts/lib/local-compose.sh`.
The local PostgreSQL containers use stable names: `agent-space-dev-postgres`,
`agent-space-test-postgres`, and `agent-space-prod-postgres`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start everything (creates ~/.aspace/dev/ and .env from template on first run)
./ops/scripts/start.sh

# 2. Add a model provider in the app
#    Open the web app → Providers and paste your API key (stored encrypted; never in .env).
#    ~/.aspace/dev/.env holds infra-only settings (e.g. POSTGRES_PASSWORD for --prod).
```

`start.sh` builds the sandbox image on first run, then starts frontend + server + deployer via Docker Compose. Data lives under **`~/.aspace/<mode>/`** (default mode `dev`). Browser API traffic reaches the TypeScript server through the frontend proxy.

```
Web UI:           http://localhost:3000   # Docker maps container 5173 → host 3000 (dev compose)
API:              http://localhost:3000/api/v1   # server entrypoint
```

### Options

```bash
./ops/scripts/start.sh           # Docker Compose — dev (default)
./ops/scripts/start.sh --test    # separate ports + ~/.aspace/test
./ops/scripts/start.sh --prod
./ops/scripts/start.sh --build   # force image rebuild
```

Test mode exposes the same API through `http://localhost:3100/api/v1`. The test frontend talks to the server service inside the compose network.
Docker-native `ops/scripts/db/migrate.sh`, DB-only `ops/scripts/db/{dump,restore,reset-postgres}.sh`,
and offline `ops/scripts/system/{backup,restore,verify-restore}.sh` start PostgreSQL
when needed and stop it after completion only when that script had to start it;
they leave already-running app stacks alone.

## Development

For server work:

```bash
cd server
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Run explicit TS migrations through the ops wrapper:

```bash
./ops/scripts/db/migrate.sh --mode dev
```

### Runtime target

The runtime is **Linux / WSL / server + browser UI**. An `apps/web/src-tauri/` directory exists
but desktop support is **deferred and not part of the current product**. If it ships later it
will be a lightweight launcher (start/stop the server, open the browser) — not a reimplementation
of the backend.

## Sandbox Architecture

LLM agents can execute arbitrary shell commands. To protect the host:

- **Default — filesystem isolation**: git worktrees + `PathPolicy` confine file access to the
  run's workspace. This is the default execution isolation (`default_sandbox_level=worktree`).
- **High-risk — one-shot Docker**: runs that require `one_shot_docker` isolation are refused
  until that product path is implemented. The sandbox image assets exist, but the app must not
  present Docker isolation as active protection for high/critical-risk runs.

The **server does not mount the Docker socket** and does not spawn host containers directly.
Sandbox containers are launched by the host-side **deployer** service, which is the only component
with `/var/run/docker.sock` mounted. The server talks to the deployer over a Unix socket
(`/aspace/run/deployer.sock`).

See [docs/THREAT_MODEL.md](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md) for the full threat analysis.

## Authentication

Local development runs without authentication. Optional Google OAuth sign-in is supported when
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are configured in the mode `.env`.
Persisted API keys are feature-gated and not enabled in the current build.

## Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Space | Personal / family / team container; every record is scoped by `space_id` |
| User | A person, may belong to multiple spaces |
| Workspace | A project, repo, or knowledge area within a space |
| Memory | Scoped long-term information; written only via proposal → approval workflow |
| Capability | Code-defined skill registered via `capability.yaml` manifest |
| Sandbox | Per-run isolation; git worktree by default; one-shot Docker-required paths fail closed until implemented |
| Adapter | Execution backend: `echo`, `model_api`, `claude_code`, `codex_cli`, `opencode` |

## Built-in Templates

No concrete agents are seeded. Built-in behavior comes from system **AgentTemplates**
(reusable factories, seeded once globally); a concrete Agent is created on demand via
copy-on-create, and runtime always loads config from its `AgentVersion` — never a template.

There is no `general_chat` template and no DirectChat — chat is the per-space **system-managed
default Assistant** (`agent_kind=system_assistant`), minted from the internal `personal_assistant`
seed spec. That seed spec is `visibility=system_internal`: hidden from the public Template Library
and not user-instantiable (at most one active Assistant per space). The reusable specialized
templates below are the public library:

| Template | Category | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `activity_reflector` | reflection | Processes captures/activity into typed proposals + reflection summary; model selects output type |
| `memory_reflector` | memory | Memory update/merge/delete proposals only (no direct write) |
| `knowledge_curator` | knowledge | Proposes semantic KnowledgeItem types, relations, source links (proposal-only) |
| `research_reader` | research | Reads selected sources only (no web search/crawl); summaries, questions, knowledge proposals |
| `coding_reviewer` | workspace | Read-only review/report outputs; no file write, shell, or patch apply |

Memory reflection is also exposed as an internal service (`MemoryReflector` via the
`memory.reflect` capability, `POST /sessions/{id}/reflect`).
